<p>Sometimes it is better to see something than read about it.
</p><p>
You're trying to learn a new programming language. Pages upon pages of written documentation are, supposedly, available. But the documentation published by the company just lists the available functions, the tutorial you found keeps referring to a button you can't seem to find, and the code example you found seems to be incomplete.
</p><p>
Frustrated, you make your way over to YouTube and look for a video. In it, you can see the button is hidden in a submenu, and your code example is missing a key import statement.
</p><p>
By watching someone use a programming language, you can see the little things that other forms of documentation may take for granted.  Watching a video can put you in the drivers seat; you can see exactly where the screen was clicked and exactly what was typed. This provides you with information the creator may be so tacitly familiar with that they don't think to mention it.
