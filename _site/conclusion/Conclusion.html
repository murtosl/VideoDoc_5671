				<h3>When to Make Video Documentation</h3>

<p>Video documentation can be made by anyone, however, those that put additional effort into the creation of the video will help the viewers significantly. Rehearsing, having decent quality, editing and creating supplemental materials will make video documentation the most educational. 
</p>

<p>Videos are not best used as reference material; they are used to either explain concepts or show how to do tasks.  The following are key features that the videos researched in this study used:</p>

<h3>Keys to Video Documentation</h3>
<ul><li>Text must be easy for the viewer to see and read. If possible, a full screen view should not be required to see details in the video.
<li>Shorter, focused videos are best. Break videos into a series if a longer discussion is needed.
<li>An audio track that captures the thoughts of the video creator is useful, so long as the audio is free of awkward pauses and noises, and is of adequate volume.
<li>If there are items in the screen capture that would distract the viewer, the screen should be cropped or zoomed.
<li>If there are details on the screen the viewer should notice, use a method of directing the user's attention to that exact spot.
<li>Screen captures are best for showing examples. When discussing conceptual information, an alternative method should be used, such as slides.
<li>Use supplemental material to help the viewer find and use the information they need more quickly.</ul>


<p>While enhancing a screencast may take time and resources, it does not take a professional level of money or skills to do. In the end, it is the clarity of the explaination that matters. The most popular video researched in this project was a guy with a chalkboard. In the end, the sharing of information is the end goal, and additional visual features will better help viewers understand the material presented.</p>
