<h3>Video length</h3>
<p>Developers highly value brevity and focus in video documentation. The longer a video is, the less likely it is that a developer will watch the whole thing. They are usually seeking specific information and, due to a lack of search ability in video, they are less likely to find that specific information in a lengthy video. One student commented about video documentation that "I was afraid to fast-forward the video; I was afraid of skipping the details" (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015, 90). There are methods around the lack of searchability that are discussed in the next section.</p>

<p>Longer videos also do not contribute well to learning. In a study where students were learning via screencasts, one student commented "I cut the lengthy videos into parts and I study them accordingly. I could not remember anything after such (long) videos" (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015, 88). Another commented "I do not like the 20-minute videos because I cannot watch them and then explore the application; I have to stop, then experiment and then continue, then stop...It is very uncomfortable to combine practice [of the shown material] with long videos" (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015, 88).

<h3>Clarity of the Video</h3>
<ul>
<li>HD
<li>Tiny Window means it Doesnâ€™t matter even if you have HD 
<li>The stop/pause theory: If the user is following your instructions, stopping, shrinking, doing whatever, enlarging, and starting the video can be annoying.
<li>Large enough text to read is still annoying if not HD clear
</ul>

<h3>Is Audio necessary?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is music nice?
<li>Why spoken dialogue, when there could be text?
<li>Speaking too slow or stumbly.
</ul>
