<h3>Cropping the Window</h3>

<p>Many screencasts are recorded from the view the user would see as they use a technology. This view can be manipulated to aid in focusing the viewer's attention. By controlling the gaze of the viewer, the video creator can remove the distance between the author and the audience (Rose 2012, 164). This further lets the viewer feel like they are performing the actions that are shown in a screencast. Adjusting the framing can keep the viewer from being distracted by other items on the screen, while still feeling like they're using the application.</p>

<ul class="noBullet">
<li><figure><img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/6_fullScreen.png"/><figcaption>(#6)</figcaption></figure> <b>The Whole Window</b> - This type of view shows the entire screen, with nothing removed. Features of the operating system, such as the dock or taskbar, are shown even though they are not used throughout the video. This unedited view can help orientate the viewer, or may be necessary if multiple applications are being used at one time. However, it could also be distracting to the viewer if irrelevant items are on the screen.

<li><figure><img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/16_windowOnly.png"/><figcaption>(#16)</figcaption></figure> <b>Program Focused</b> -  It is possible to show only one program to the viewer of a screencast. This can be useful if the program is the only one needed to be used, such as the command prompt or Visual Studio. The viewer will be unable to see any of the operating system interface, or any other programs running nearby. This gives the ultimate ability to focus the viewer's attention on the application being demonstrated.

<li><figure><img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/7_cutOffScreen.png"/><figcaption>(#7)</figcaption></figure> <b>Screen Cropping</b> - The video can crop out extra information on the screen, so that only a relevant piece of the screen is shown. For instance, an installation program may have multiple windows that open, but these windows always open in the middle of the screen. The video can be cropped to only show the middle of the screen, so the viewer is only focusing on where the installation program appears. 

<li><figure><img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/14_zooming.gif"/><figcaption>(#14)</figcaption></figure> <b>Zooming</b> - The video may zoom into a relevant part of the screen, and then zoom out or pan elsewhere when the viewer needs to focus somewhere else. This provides a great amount of flexibility towards what is shown, as long as certain needed information is not cut off. Because the video creator is not viewing the zoom as they are recording, it is possible that they are not recording what they think they are. An example of this happens in video 13.
</ul>

<p>Once again, these features should be used when appropriate.  Showing the whole window is effective when there are no additional applications running, and the video creator does not have a distracting images or icons on their desktop. Zooming can be useful to draw the viewer's attention to a certain part of the screen, but can get distracting if used too much or if something important is cut off. </p>


<h3>Directing Attention</h3>

<p>Directing the viewer's attention to specific locations or actions on a screen may be necessary to ensure the viewer understands what is being shown. Sometimes changes are small or subtle, and simply framing the shot is not detailed enough to direct the viewer's attention. While adding additional information to the screen may briefly remind the viewer that they are not the ones controlling the action, this does not tend to distract them from learning the information. Rather, it simply reminds them that watching the video is more like mimicking an action (Rose 2012, 170). There are several methods that can be used to do this, including emphasizing the mouse location, and zooming in on the screen. </p>

<ul class="noBullet">
<li><figure><img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/5_clickHighGif.gif"/><figcaption>(#5)</figcaption></figure> <b>Click Highlighting</b> -  Click highlighting emphasizes the location where the screen was clicked. The highlight will draw the viewer's eyes to that location, even if the screen caster moves the mouse after clicking. Although certain software may perform an animation when a mouse click occurs, most of the time there is no visual indication that a click occurred. By having click highlighting, the viewer can know that the screen caster clicked an area of the screen, even if the screen caster does not explicitly mention it.

<li><figure><img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/7_crop_mouseHigh.JPG"/><figcaption>(#7)</figcaption></figure> <b>Mouse Highlighting</b> - Mouse Highlighting emphasizes the location where the mouse pointer is located.  The mouse pointer moves throughout the screen, and can be difficult for the viewer to track. This can be especially true if the video is small, or of poor quality. By highlighting the mouse's location, the viewer can have a better idea of where the mouse is located at any given moment. Mouse highlighting can be on constantly, or used when the screen caster thinks viewers may have problems finding the mouse pointer.

<li><figure><img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/18_arrow.gif"/><figcaption>(#18)</figcaption></figure> <b>Drawing on the Screen</b> - A video creator may put icons, including arrows and boxes, onto the screen to direct the viewer's attention. They may even have the appearance of this icon be animated. This can be a useful technique as it can be used to outline buttons, or point to specific characters.

<li><b>Notable Movement</b> - The easiest way to capture the viewer's attention is simply to wiggle the mouse where the viewer should look. Motion easily captures the viewer's attention, and no extra software is needed to use this method. If the video creator is working primarily with text, highlighting the text has a similar effect to moving the mouse, and also requires no additional software. This technique can easily be seen in the other animations on this page -  the eye sees the mouse movements in each picture quickly.
</ul>

<p class="innerImg"><span class="fakeCaption"><img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/16_highlighting.gif"/>(#16)</span> Each of the above techniques has a time and a place. Mouse highlighting is not going to be useful is a video where the screen caster is primarily editing text: the mouse is hardly being used. Click highlighting is not necessary if the buttons being clicked are already animated. However, when details become very important and hard to notice, such as when a single character in a line of code needs to be highlighted, directing the viewer's attention can be crucial. It is very difficult to direct the viewer's attention to a missing semi-colon without somehow emphasizing it. </p>
