<h3>Directing Attention</h3>

<p>Directing the viewer's attention to specific locations or actions on a screen may be necessary to ensure the viewer understands what is being shown. There are several methods that can be used to do this, including emphasizing the mouse location, and zooming in on the screen. </p>

<ul class="noBullet">
<li><img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/5_clickHighGif.gif"/> <b>Click Highlighting</b> -  Click highlighting emphasizes the location where the screen was clicked. The highlight will draw the viewer's eyes to that location, even if the screen caster moves the mouse after clicking. Although certain software may perform an animation when a mouse click occurs, most of the time there is no visual indication that a click occurred. By having click highlighting, the viewer can know that the screen caster clicked an area of the screen, even if the screen caster does not explicitly mention it.

<li><img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/7_crop_mouseHigh.JPG"/> <b>Mouse Highlighting</b> - Mouse Highlighting emphasizes the location where the mouse pointer is located.  The mouse pointer moves throughout the screen, and can be difficult for the viewer to track. This can be especially true if the video is small, or of poor quality. By highlighting the mouse's location, the viewer can have a better idea of where the mouse is located at any given moment. Mouse highlighting can be on constantly, or used when the screen caster thinks viewers may have problems finding the mouse pointer.


<li><img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/17_arrow.gif"/> <b>Drawing on the Screen</b> - A video creator may put icons, including arrows and boxes, onto the screen to direct the viewer's attention. They may even have the appearance of this icon be animated. This can be a useful technique as it can be used to outline buttons, or point to specific characters.

<li><b>Notable Movement</b> - The easiest way to capture the viewer's attention is simply to wiggle the mouse where the viewer should look. Motion easily captures the viewer's attention, and no extra software is needed to use this method. If the video creator is working primarily with text, highlighting the text has a similar effect to moving the mouse, and also requires no additional software.
</ul>

<p>Each of the above techniques has a time and a place. Mouse highlighting is not going to be useful is a video where the screen caster is primarily editing text: the mouse is hardly being used. Click highlighting is not necessary if the buttons being clicked are already animated. However, when details become very important and hard to notice, such as when a single character in a line of code needs to be highlighted, directing the userâ€™s attention can be crucial. It is very difficult to direct the viewer's attention to a missing semi-colon without somehow emphasizing it. <img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/1_yellowUnderline.png"/> </p>
