				<h2>Presenting Information</h2>

<p>When discussing code, or the way an application functions, it may be best to show the viewer how the information looks on the computer screen. However, having code or an application on the screen may be distracting to the viewer when presenting conceptual information. Rather than listening to the information being provided, the viewer may be waiting for action to happen on the screen, or looking at the layout of the application. Generally, there are four ways to  present information:</p>

<h3>Software Demonstration</h3>
<figure><img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/18_softDemo.gif"/><figcaption>(#9)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Most video documentation is in the form of a software demonstration. The video creator will record themselves using software to complete a task. This type of demonstration lets the viewer see the process for completing a task in action, and can help eliminate the viewer from being unable to find a certain button or setting.</p>

<p>If any code is needed during the software demonstration, video makers may write out any lines of code they need beforehand. They can then copy and paste them into the application. This avoid creating an error while recording the video, but also does not show the creation or debugging process.</p>

<h3>Live Coding</h3>
<figure><img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/9_liveCode.gif"/><figcaption>(#9)</figcaption></figure>
<p> Live coding is the process of recording the screencast as the video creator is writing the program. Instead of using pre-selected snippets of code, or showing a fully tested and functional program, the video creator writes out, debugs and runs the program for the viewer. This can mean the video recorder makes mistakes in their demonstration. However, it can be useful to see how the video creator solves the issues the come across. </p>

<p>If the video creator wants to talk about code without the possibility of making mistakes, there are alternatives to live coding. The video creator can show a fully written program that has been created before the video was made, and not make any code changes as they record.  A verbal explaination of what the code is doing and how will make up for not seeing the code being typed.</p>

<h3>Slides</h3>
<p class="innerImg"><span class="fakeCaption"><img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/10_slides.png"/>(#10)</span>Slides may be used to present conceptual information, just like it was being presented in a speech. Slides may also be useful if specific syntax or examples codes are being presented. Using slides allows text on the screen to emphasis ideas being discussed, and may help the viewer receive a visual reinforcement of new concepts. </p>

<h3>Personal footage</h3>
<p class="innerImg"><span class="fakeCaption"><img src="/VideoDoc_5671/images/8_theGuy.png"/>(#8)</span>Some video creators may film themselves discussing concepts, or introducing the video. This can make the video feel like it has a formal presenter and adds a personal touch into the video. When the presenter is not seen, it may feel like the video is an anonymous example of a technology, rather than something presented by an actual human. While developers enjoy the social and personal aspects of video documentation, including the human presenter may make the video less brief or not contribute to the sharing of information. A video creator should decide whether slides or a brief introduction is more effective than showing footage of themselves talking.</p>
