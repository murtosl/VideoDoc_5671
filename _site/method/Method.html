				<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>Hubert Knoblauch & Ren&#233; Tuma have created a method for analyzing video in a rhetorical manner. Rather than trying to perform a full content analysis of screencasts, a daunting task for an individual, a selection of videos will be viewed from various sources and producers. The videos will range from amateur to professional production and also vary from beginner level topics to advanced topics. The videos will then be coded with features they contain. </p>

<p>Once the videos have been coded, the various activities the videos contain can be considered relevant or irrelevant. These relevant activities can be compared to the activities in other videos. In order to compare these activities, the activities can be further coded and analyzed to find more parallels between them, until the research data is sufficient. This ends up being an iterative coding process, with multiple rounds of analysis.</p>

<p>In order for the videos to be fairly similar, all screencasts will be related to MySQL. A beginning level video would be creating a basic select query, while an advanced tutorial would be making configuration changes to the database server. Videos with no editing, no additional material and low to medium footage or audio quality would be amateur videos. Videos with editing, excellent footage and audio quality, and with additional material would be considered professional. The level of professionalism is not based on the technical skills of the video creator, but rather the skills and effort put into the screencast itself.</p>
