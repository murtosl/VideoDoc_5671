<p>Sometimes it is better to see something than read about it.
</p><p>
When trying to learn a new programming language, pages upon pages of written documentation may be available. But the documentation published by the company just lists the available functions, the tutorials keeps referring to an unfindable button, and the code examples seem to be incomplete. These problems may be solved by watching a video of someone using the language.</p><p>
When watching video documentation, the viewer can see the little things that other forms of documentation may take for granted. A video puts the viewer in the driver's seat; they can see exactly where the screen was clicked and exactly what was typed. This visual communication helps show information with which the video creator may be tacitly familiar, and wouldn't think to mention.</p>
