				<h2>INTRO</h2>

<p>Sometimes it is better to see something than read about it.
</p><p>
You're trying to learn a new programming language. Pages upon pages of written documentation are, supposedly, available. But the documentation published by the company just lists the available functions, the tutorial you found keeps referring to a button you can't seem to find, and the code example you found seems to be incomplete.
</p><p>
Frustrated, you make your way over to YouTube and look for a video. In it, you can see the button is hidden in a submenu, and your code example is missing a key import statement.
</p><p>
By watching someone use a programming language, you can see the little things that other forms of documentation may take for granted.  Watching a video can put you in the drivers seat; you can see exactly where the screen was clicked and exactly what was typed. This provides you with information the creator may be so tacitly familiar with that they don't think to mention it. 
</p><p>
Video documentation started to be explored in the late 1980s, although the process was very experimental. One company had their lead developers discuss their programs in a lecture, and recorded it on VHS. This lecture was then stored for other developers at the company to view in the future. At that time, this was a cheaper alternative to printing and maintaining a massive, book-sized, printed manual (Demarco and Geertgens 1990, 1-2). 
</p><p>
Nowadays, video documentation isn't used to save on the cost of paper, but to spread information worldwide. Video documentation can be made directly by the creators of a language to attract new users, made by the a system administrator that wants to share what she's learned, or made by a casual programmer during his free time for fun. With so many different sources of video documentation, the documentation can also take on different levels of quality.
</p>

<p style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">Documentation quality. That's a sentence. Yes, indeed. I'm going to finish this later so I can summarize what I actually find better.</p>
