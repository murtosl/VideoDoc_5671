One company had their lead developers discuss their programs in a lecture, and recorded it on VHS. This lecture was then stored for other developers at the company to view in the future. At that time, storing video tapes was a cheaper alternative to printing and maintaining a massive, book-sized, printed manual (Demarco and Geertgens 1990, 126-127). 
</p>
<p>
Nowadays, video documentation isn't used to save on the cost of paper, but to spread information worldwide. Video documentation can be made directly by the creators of a program to attract new users, made by the a system administrator that wants to share what she's learned at work, or made by a casual programmer during his free time. With so many different sources of video documentation, the documentation can also take on different levels of quality.
</p>
<p>Research has shown that developers create video documentation "to support learning and follow [rich-media] trends in their community" (Bergen, MacLeod and Storey 2015, 105). Many video creators have enjoyed watching videos made by other developers, and enjoy producing their own videos. Overall, they enjoy creating videos to share their knowledge with other developers (Bergen, MacLeod and Storey 2015). However, research has not truly established when video documentation is effective. Picking a documentation format because it is fun or trendy is not a good reason. A documentation format should be chosen because it effectively informs its viewers.
</p>


<p>Video documentation is praised for directly showing how things move and change on the screen when a software is being used. This can capture tacit information the video creator does not actively think about. Tacit information may be ignored in other documentation formats, since it is not automatically captured (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015, 83).</p>

<p>It has also been suggested that video documentation feels more like one-on-one instruction, and is more comfortable to use than static documents (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015, 83).  Video documentation can also make the viewer feel as if they are performing the task themselves, while avoiding the trial and error that comes with learning a new task (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015, 84).</p>

<p>Trial and error can be important when learning. In one study, it was found that when students who had watched screencasts attempted to perform tasks that were slightly different from the screencasts, the students were not successful. This may be because students are too focus on mimicking what they see on the screen rather than understanding the tasks being shown. The students may understand what they're doing on a surface level, but it doesn't make a deeper connection in the brain. The screencast created "only the illusion of capability" (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015, 84).  Although, "almost all studies have shown that [screencasts] are just as effective as or more effective than textual descriptions in initial acquisition of software skills and, usually, offer quicker and more accurate immediate demonstration of procedures,", in the long term the information doesn't seem to be retained well (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015,  83). 
</p>

<p>
 If video documentation is meant to be useful, the information in it should be able to be understood as well as possible. Understanding can be aided by the visual features found in and around the video. With so many professional and amateur sources of video documentation, different formatting and styles have been experimented with. By rhetorically analyzing video documentation, guidelines can be established so developers are getting the information they need.
