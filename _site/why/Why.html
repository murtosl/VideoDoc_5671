				<h2>Why Video Documentation?</h2>

<p>Video documentation started to be explored in the late 1980s, although the process was very experimental. One company had their lead developers discuss their programs in a lecture, and recorded it on VHS. This lecture was then stored for other developers at the company to view in the future. At that time, this was a cheaper alternative to printing and maintaining a massive, book-sized, printed manual (Demarco and Geertgens 1990, 126-127). 
</p>
<p>
Nowadays, video documentation isn't used to save on the cost of paper, but to spread information worldwide. Video documentation can be made directly by the creators of a language to attract new users, made by the a system administrator that wants to share what she's learned, or made by a casual programmer during his free time for fun. With so many different sources of video documentation, the documentation can also take on different levels of quality.
</p>
<p>Research has shown that developers create screencasts "to support learning and follow [rich-media] trends in their community" (Bergen, MacLeod and Storey 2015, 105). Many screencasters have enjoyed watching screencasts made by other developers, and enjoy producing their own videos. Overall, they enjoy sharing their knowledge with other developers by creating video documentation (Bergen, MacLeod and Storey 2015). However, research has not truly established when video documentation is effective. Picking a documentation format because it is fun or trendy is not a good reason. A documentation format should be chosen because it effectively informs its viewers.
</p>


<p>Screencasts are praised for directly showing how things transform, and moved on the screen when a software is being used. This tacit information is better understood when seen, and may be ignored in other documentation styles. It has been suggested that video documentation feels more like one-on-one instruction, and is more comfortable to use than static documents.</p>

<p>When the viewer is watching what needs to be done on the same device they'll be using, they don't need to jump between mediums, such as between a book and a computer. By staying on the same device, it can feel like the viewer is performing the task themselves. There are also additional benefits, such as the viewer avoiding trial and error. However, trial and error can be useful when learning.</p>

<p>In one study, it was found that when students watched screencasts and then had to perform tasks that were different from the specific ones students studied, or where deeper knowledge is needed, the students were not successful. This may be because students are too focus on mimicking what they see on the screen rather than understanding the tasks being shown. The students may understand what they're doing on a surface level, but what they're doing doesn't make a deeper connection in the brain. The screencast created "only the illusion of capability" (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015, 84).  Although, "almost all studies have shown that [screencasts] are just as effective as or more effective than textual descriptions in initial acquisition of software skills and, usually, offer quicker and more accurate immediate demonstration of procedures,", in the long term the information doesn't seem to stick well (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015,  83). 
</p>

<p>
 If video documentation is meant to be clearly useful, the information in it should be able to stick as well as possible. This can be aided by the visual features found in and around the video. With so many professional and amateur sources of video documentation, different formatting and styles have been used. By rhetorically analyzing video documentation, guidelines can be established so developers are getting the information they need.
