<h3>Keys to Video Documentation</h3>

<p>Video documentation can be made by anyone; however, those that put additional effort into the creation of the video will help the viewers significantly. Rehearsing, having decent video and audio quality, editing, and creating supplemental materials will make video documentation the most informative. The following guidelines should be followed to make effective video documentation:
</p>


<ul><li>Text must be easy for the viewer to see and read. If possible, a full screen view should not be required to see details in the video.
<li>Shorter, focused videos are best. Break videos into a series if a longer discussion is needed.
<li>An audio track that captures the thoughts of the video creator is useful, so long as the audio is free of awkward pauses and sounds.
<li>If there are items in the screen capture that would distract the viewer, the screen should be cropped or zoomed.
<li>If there are details on the screen the viewer should notice, use a method of directing the user's attention to that exact spot.
<li>Screen captures are best for showing examples. When discussing conceptual information, slides or alternative footage should be used.
<li>Use supplemental material to help the viewer find and use the information they need more quickly.</ul>

<p>While enhancing video documentation may take time and resources, it does not take a professional level of skills to do. Sharing knowledge is the end goal, and additional visual features will better help viewers understand the material presented. In the end, it is the clarity of the explanation that matters, but for true clarity, all aspects in and around the video should be utilized to help the viewer.</p>
