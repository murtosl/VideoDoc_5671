<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>When should you just skip making a video?
<ul><li>No one making a video tried to explain specific functions. Videos are not reference materials; they are used to either: <ul> 
<li>Explain Concepts
<li>Show how to do tasks
<li>Videos made by companies weren't always the highest quality.
<li>Videos with low quality sometimes explained things well. Chalkboard guy had the best verbal explanation of MySQL.
</ul></ul></p>
<p>What do you need in a video?
<ul><li>Readable text. Hands down.
<li>Shorter the better. Make a series.
<li>If you have audio, good pacing, speech and clarity
<li>A way to draw attention to smaller material (like semicolons)
<li>If you're going conceptual, showing your screen may not be useful.
<li>If you need examples, show it.
