<h3>Keys to Video Documentation</h3>

<p>Video documentation can be made by anyone; however, those that put additional effort into the creation of the video will help the viewers significantly. Rehearsing, having decent video and audio quality, editing, and creating supplemental materials will make video documentation the most informative. The following guidelines should be followed to make effective video documentation:
</p>


<ul><li>Text must be easy for the viewer to see and read. If possible, a full screen view should not be required to see details in the video.
<li>Shorter, focused videos are best. Break videos into a series if a longer discussion is needed.
<li>Audio that is free of awkward pauses and sounds can best captures the thoughts of the video creator.
<li>Crop or zoom the screen if there are items in the screen capture that would distract the viewer.
<li>Point or highlight small details the viewer should notice.
<li>Screen captures are best for showing examples. Slides or alternative footage are better when discussing conceptual information.
<li>Supplemental material help the viewer find and use the information they need more quickly.</ul>

<p>While enhancing video documentation may take time and resources, it does not take a professional level of skills to do. Sharing knowledge is the end goal, and additional visual features will better help viewers understand the material presented. In the end, it is the clarity of the explanation that matters, and anything that aids in that clairty should be used. All aspects in and around the video should be utilized to help the viewer learn the knowledge the video is trying to share.</p>
