<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>Hubert Knoblauch & Ren&#233; Tuma have created a method for analyzing video in a rhetorical manner. Rather than trying to perform a full content analysis of screencasts, a daunting task for an individual, a selection of videos will be viewed from various producers and sources. The videos will range from amateur to professional production levels, and also vary from beginner level topics to advanced topics. The videos will then be coded with features they contain. </p>

<p>Once the videos have been coded, the various activities the videos contain can be considered relevant or irrelevant. These relevant activities can then be compared to the activities in other videos. In order to compare these activities, the activities can be further coded and analyzed to find more parallels between them, until the research data is sufficient. This ends up being an iterative coding process, with multiple rounds of analysis.</p>
