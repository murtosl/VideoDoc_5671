<h2>Video Qualities</h2>

<p>Videos are more than just the footage they show. They have a certain length and a certain level of quality. They are shown and used on various websites. Looking at not only what is shown in the video, but qualities of the video itself can provide further guidance towards what viewers of video documentation may find useful.</p>

<h3>Video length</h3>
<p>Developers highly value brevity and focus in video documentation. The longer a video is, the less likely it is that a developer will watch the whole thing. They are usually seeking specific information and, due to a lack of search ability in video, they are less likely to find that specific information in a lengthy video. One student commented about video documentation that "I was afraid to fast-forward the video; I was afraid of skipping the details" (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015, 90). There are methods around the lack of searchability that are discussed in the next section.</p>

<p>Longer videos also do not contribute well to learning. In a study where students were learning via screencasts, one student commented "I cut the lengthy videos into parts and I study them accordingly. I could not remember anything after such (long) videos" (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015, 88). Another commented "I do not like the 20-minute videos because I cannot watch them and then explore the application; I have to stop, then experiment and then continue, then stop...It is very uncomfortable to combine practice [of the shown material] with long videos" (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015, 88).
</p>

<p>Some video creators who wish to make a longer series of videos will break up the videos into a series of videos. This makes it easier for viewers of the video to learn as much or as little as they need. One student being studied noted that "I decide on the videos that I am going to study according to the time I have at my disposal" (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015, 92).  When a video is too long, it is not only harder to find information relevant to the viewer, but they may avoid the documentation altogether as they feel they don't have the time to view longer material. Breaking up what could be one longer video into a series of task or subjects makes the video more appealing to viewers.</p>


<h3>Clarity of the Video</h3>

<p class="innerImg"><span class="fakeCaption"><img style="width: 500px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/13_selfCommentary.png"/>(#13)</span>Video documentation tends to display a significant amount of text. It not only benefits the viewer to be able to see this text clearly, but may be necessary if they need to use the code themselves. Having large enough text, and clear enough text to read what is being typed or presented on the screen is a major aid to the viewer's ability to use the documentation. <br/><br/>

Text may be able to be enlarged by zooming in the video (as seen in video #13), or by putting that specific text on a slide (as seen in video #3). But even if text is enlarged, the viewer may be put off by the poor quality of the text's appearance. The table below shows how the quality difference between command line prompt text in an HD video and a non-HD video. Even though the text in the non-HD is larger, the HD text is still easier to read.<br/><br/>

Furthermore, the environment the video is contained in may also affect the clarity of the text. In the example to the left from #13, the code shown in the video is impossible to read in the native YouTube environment. It is far too small. The code is still difficult when the video is viewed full-screen, because the video is not in HD. The video uses zooming to improve visibility but, as the author notes in the YouTube comments, it would have been better if the entire video was available in HD.

</table>

<h3>Audio</h3>

<p>A video naturally means visual information. Most videos also include audio, but not all of them. In the sample of videos selected, two videos do not contain any spoken audio:  #14 and #15. Instead, these videos use text on the screen to present additional information.  This raises the question if audio is necessary.</p>

<p>In an early research study of video documentation, a viewer noted, "The designer's intent was clearer in the videos than in any written design documentation I've ever seen. Being able to hear in the designer's own words, his point-of view, focus, approaches evaluated and rejected, etc., provides a framework in which new design decisions can be made" (Demarco and Geertgens 1990, 127). </p>

<p>It can be valuable to hear thoughts. This not only makes the video more personal: a commentary aids the in viewers understanding of the topic. While it is possible to present this information in a visual format, an ongoing verbal commentary is more likely to capture the video creator's thoughts than text snippets that need to written out and designed - a far less spontaneous process. </p>

<p>If video documentation's benefit is to capture tacitly understood information, then audio is necessary a majority of the time. The computer may be able to record the video creator's actions, but the microphone will capture the video creator's thoughts. The creator’s thoughts may be limited by space on the screen if they choose to not express these thoughts verbally, which may lead to important information being removed from the presentation.</p>

<p>However, there is a necessary level of polish needed in the documentation's audio.  Unplanned audio, such as in #8, may be filled with stutters, awkward pauses, or confusing phrasing. Poor audio quality, such as the audio containing background static or being too quiet as seen in #13, can make well-planned speeches be difficult to listen to. A good microphone and practice of the presentation is necessary for successful video documentation.</p>

<h3>Video Environment</h3>

<p class="innerImg"><span class="fakeCaption"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/16_smallEnv.png"/>(#16)</span>The size of a video, its audio and its length can affect the viewer’s ability to use the video effectively. This is most noteworthy when the user is trying to perform a task as they watch the video. The viewer needs to be able to watch the video and work at the same time. This usually means the video cannot be expected to be viewed at a full screen size, but will be viewed at the size it is available on the host website. This size may be too small, as seen to the left. <br/><br/>
If the video needs to be viewed at a large size, the viewer will need to stop, shrink and minimize the video every time they perform an action. When a video is showing a long step-by-step process, this can become very tedious. Audio can help with this by removing the need to watch the video. Ensuring any text the viewer is likely to copy is easily visible will also help.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is best to create supplemental resources in addition to the video in order to overcome these weaknesses. These will be discussed in the next section.
