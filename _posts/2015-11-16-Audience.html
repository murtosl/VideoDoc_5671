<h2>Knowing Your Audience</h2>

<p>For video documentation to be effective, it's important to know what developers look for in documentation. Overall, developers will differ which kind of documentation they prefer by their level of experience with the topic or the complexity of the task they are trying to achieve.</p>

<p>Application developers "want need-to-know information, not nice-to-know information. Because of this, few users are interested in long tutorials or hours in a classroom. They want to begin coding immediately and be directed to the specific help section that answers their specific coding problem" (Brohme et all. 2002, 138). The ability to use documentation for quick reference becomes very crucial; "programmers will not read manuals from start to finish but will refer to them if they have a problem" (Brohme et all. 2002, 139). Long series of text or videos will most likely not be used in their entirety. The people watching them are only interested in very specific information.</p>

<p>One study found that the following were "most contributing to a documents' effectiveness: content, how up-to-date it is, availability, and use of examples" (Alexander, Ralph and Rosso 2015, 3). If the documentation found was outdated, or did now show how to use what it was discussing, the documentation was not as useful. Examples and code samples are very valuable to developers, as it saves them typing time and helps them find a solution faster.</p>

<p>From this, we can conclude the following are keys to successful documentation:<p>
<ol>
	<li>A narrow focus of topic
	<li>Code samples and examples
	<li>Quick access and reference
	<li>Brevity
</ol>
