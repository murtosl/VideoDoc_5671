<h2>Knowing Your Audience</h2>

<p>For video documentation to be effective, it's important to know what developers look for in documentation. Overall, developers will differ which kind of documentation they prefer by their level of experience with the topic or the complexity of the task they are trying to achieve.</p>

<p>Application developers "want need-to-know information, not nice-to-know information. Because of this, few users are interested in long tutorials or hours in a classroom. They want to begin coding immediately and be directed to the specific help section that answers their specific coding problem" (Broehme et all. 2002, 138). The ability to use documentation for quick reference becomes very crucial; "programmers will not read manuals from start to finish but will refer to them if they have a problem" (Broehme et all. 2002, 139). Long series of text or videos will most likely not be used in their entirety. The people watching them are only interested in very specific information.</p>

<p>One study found that the following were "most contributing to a documents' effectiveness: content, how up-to-date it is, availability, and use of examples" (Alexander, Ralph and Rosso 2015, 3). If the documentation found was outdated, or did now show how to use what it was discussing, the documentation was not as useful. Examples and code samples are very valuable to developers, as it saves them typing time and helps them find a solution faster.</p>


<p>Video documentation is generally liked as a documentation format by developers. Many viewers feel video documentation has "a significant advantage in that learning is less impersonal and there is a sense of social presence" (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015, 87). Video documentation "affords the opportunity to present a sometimes dry subject such as software standards with enthusiasm and even passion" (Demarco and Geertgens 1990, 128). It seems that developers turn to video documentation not only to gather information, but because it is a more stimulating format.</p>

<p>Although developers may enjoy watching video documentation more, they are also affected by its weaknesses. Searchability is often lacking in video documentation; developers must watch "the whole video and hope that it contains the information they are looking for, or moving on to a different piece of content.... Another limitation of screencasts is that some forms of information are more easily digested as text. Specifically, explicit and formal knowledge is easier to codify in a written form" (Bergen, MacLeod and Storey 2015, 112). Since developers want to find information quickly, videos are not a good format for information that is meant to be used for reference. The lack of searchability and quick viewing makes video a poor choice in these situations.</p>

<p>From this, we can conclude the following are keys to successful video documentation:<p>
<ol>
	<li>A narrow focus of topic
	<li>Code samples and examples
	<li>Has personality
	<li>Searchability
	<li>Brevity
</ol>
