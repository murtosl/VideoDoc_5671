<h2>Why Video Documentation?</h2>

<p>Video documentation started to be explored in the late 1980s, although the process was very experimental. One company had their lead developers discuss their programs in a lecture, and recorded it on VHS. This lecture was then stored for other developers at the company to view in the future. At that time, this was a cheaper alternative to printing and maintaining a massive, book-sized, printed manual (Demarco and Geertgens 1990, 1-2).

Nowadays, video documentation isn't used to save on the cost of paper, but to spread information worldwide. Video documentation can be made directly by the creators of a language to attract new users, made by the a system administrator that wants to share what she's learned, or made by a casual programmer during his free time for fun. With so many different sources of video documentation, the documentation can also take on different levels of quality.
</p>
<p>Research has shown that developers use screencasts “to support learning and follow [rich-media] trends in their community. (Bergen, MacLeod and Storey 2015, 105).” Many screencasters have enjoyed watching screencasts made by other developers, and enjoy producing their own videos. Overall, they enjoy sharing their knowledge with other developers by creating video documentation (Bergen, MacLeod and Storey 2015). However, research has not truly established when video documentation is effective. Picking a documentation format because it is fun or trendy is not a good reason. A documentation format should be chosen because it effectively informs its viewers.

 With so many professional and amateur sources of video documentation, different formatting and styles have been used. By rhetorically analyzing video documentation, guidelines can be established so developers are getting the information they need.
