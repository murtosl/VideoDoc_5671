<h2>Supplmental Material</h2>

<p>Video documentation has several downsides. Video documentation is not searchable: the content of the video must be watched to see if it answers the viewer's questions. Viewers need supplemental material because "titles, descriptions, or summaries cannot reveal the details of the learning content. Searching is based on metadata attributes and depends on the remembering of the screenshots and their context" (Despotakis and Palaigeorgiou 2015, 89). There are several things outside of the video that can be added to make up for these weaknesses.</p>

<h3>Supplemental Text</h3>
<p>Supplemental text can be an expanded summary of what the video will contain. This can help a viewer decide if it is worth their time to watch the video. Supplemental text may also link to other resources the viewer may find useful. </p>

<h3>Transcripts </h3>
<p class="innerImg"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/4_transcript.png"/> When a viewer is curious if a video contains content that will help them, a transcript can be useful. The transcript can be skimmed to find relevant content without having to watch the entire video.  It can also be useful for viewers who do not natively speak the language of the video documentation: "Outside of the USA, there are many programmers for which English is their second language. For these programmers, reference documentation and on-line help is the preferred structure. Instructor-led classroom training is more difficult for them to learn from because of the speed of speech and the differences in accents" (Broehme et all. 2002, 138).  By providing written transcripts, viewers can read what was spoken and more easily understand the documentation. </p>

<h3>Timestamps</h3>
<p class="innerImg"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/11_transcriptTimer.png"/> A video creator can mark the times when certain topics are discussed within the video. These timestamps may or may not be inline with a transcript. The timestamp can even cause the video to start playing at that specific point in time. This keeps the viewer from having to scroll through the video and lets them know exactly when relevant information is being discussed. This not only eases video searchability, but let's the video be used for reference when a viewer wants to revisit a specific part of the video.</p>

<h3>Code Samples</h3>
<p class="innerImg"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/17_codeSample.png"/>Code samples are code that is shown within the video, but available outside the video in text form. This can range from a fully downloadable application to little snippets of text. Samples are a highly valued feature for viewers, who find it very informative to have a 10 lines or less sample of code they can copy and paste into their work (Broehme et all. 2002, 140). This aids the viewer by providing them with a working bit of code to play with. It also saves the viewer time by letting them copy and paste the text instead of having to retype it.</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>
<p class="innerImg"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/11_comments.png"/>Comments are a common feature in any online location. Comments in videos can be useful in expanding the social nature of video documentation. Other viewers can ask and answer questions about the topic in the video. They can also provide feedback to the video creator, such as mentioning that a video is too long. It can be useful for the viewer to read other's notes and questions about the video so they do not have to look for clarification in another location, but the comments are not meant to make up for a poorly made video.</p>
