<h2>Presenting Information</h2>

<p>When discussing code, or the way an application functions, it may be best to show the viewer how the information looks on the computer screen. However, having code or an application on the screen may be distracting to the viewer when presenting conceptual information. Rather than listening to the information being provided, the viewer may be waiting for action to happen on the screen, or looking at the layout of the application. Generally, there are three ways to  present information:</p>

<h3>Live Coding</h3>
<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/9_liveCode.gif"/> Live coding is the process of recording the screencast as the video creator is writing the program. Instead of using pre-selected snippets of code, or showing a fully tested and functional program, the video creator writes out, debugs and runs the program for the viewer. This can mean the video recorder makes mistakes in their demonstration. However, it can be useful to see how the video creator solves the issue they may have introduced. </p>
<p>Other video makers write out any lines of code they need beforehand and copy and paste them into the application. They also may only show a fully written program that has been created before the video was made, and not make any code changes. This avoid creating an error while recording the video, but also does not show the creation or debugging process.
</p>


<h3>Slides</h3>
<p class="innerImg"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/10_slides.png"/>Slides may be used to present conceptual information, just like it was being presented in a speech. Slides may also be useful if specific syntax or examples codes are being presented. Using slides allows text on the screen to emphasis ideas being discussed, and may help the viewer receive a visual reinforcement of new concepts. </p>

<h3>Personal footage</h3>
<p class="innerImg"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/8_theGuy.png"/>Some video creators may film themselves discussing concepts, or introducing the video. This can make the video feel like it has a formal presenter and adds a personal touch into the video. When the presenter is not seen, it may feel like the video is an anonymous example of a technology, rather than something presented by an actual human. While developers enjoy the social and personal aspects of video documentation, including the human presenter may make the video less brief or not contribute to the sharing of information. A video creator should decide whether slides or a brief introduction is more effective than showing footage of themselves talking.</p>
